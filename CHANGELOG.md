## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `scripts/example_call.py` — runnable demo client showing the JSON-RPC
  handshake plus a real `tools/call`. Unit-tested.
- `scripts/sync_domain.py` — executable counterpart to the
  `.claude/skills/sync-domain` prose spec. Proposes `DOMAIN.md` additions
  from `__all__` re-exports + cross-domain imports. Read-only.
- `scripts/verify_docs.py` — executable Clara-invariant enforcer wired
  into a new `verify-docs` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Checks:
  shared/ one-way rule, doc length caps, Decision Log presence,
  cross-domain import documentation, public-surface coverage.
- Real-subprocess E2E in `tests/e2e/test_mcp_stdio.py` covering
  `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.
- HTTP `/mcp/` integration test in
  `tests/unit/apps/server/test_http_transport.py`.
- Playwright HTML fallback when `DB2ST_HTML_FALLBACK=1`
  (`src/db2st_mcp/domains/tracking/server/html_fallback.py`), including
  detection of the SPA "Shipment not found" marker.
- Response cache, circuit breaker, and schema-drift detector under
  `src/db2st_mcp/shared/`.
- Upstash-Redis-backed token store (`[redis]` extra) with a fake-Redis
  unit test.
- Bearer-token auth middleware wired into the FastAPI app, plus
  `db2st-mcp mint / tokens list / tokens revoke` CLI subcommands.
- OpenTelemetry opt-in instrumentation (`[otel]` extra) and a
  request-id correlation middleware.
- k6 load-test script (`scripts/loadtest.k6.js`).
- Bandit static security scan as a CI job.

### Changed

- Composed the MCP transport's session-manager lifespan into the parent
  FastAPI app's lifespan. Without this, any HTTP request to `/mcp/`
  crashed with `Task group is not initialized` on first request — caught
  by the new HTTP integration test.
- DOMAIN.md files updated to match actual public surface
  (`SchenkerClient.resolve` / `.fetch_detail` instead of the previously
  documented `.fetch`).
- Tooling: pre-commit `ruff` hook bumped to v0.15.13; project mypy is
  CI-only (pre-commit's isolated env can't see optional/test deps).
- `mypy --strict` is green across the codebase (was 17 errors).

### Fixed

- Lifespan composition bug above (production HTTP transport path).
- `SchenkerClient.fetch_detail` now raises `ParseError` if the upstream
  payload isn't an object, matching the parser's contract.
- `PlaywrightHtmlFallback` now raises `NotFoundError` on the SPA's
  "Shipment not found!" marker instead of returning a misleading
  "scraped" event.

### Removed

- Initial TypeScript scaffold (`package.json` / `tsconfig.json`),
  replaced by the Python project before any code shipped.

## Notes

The repo started life on 2026-05-15 and reached "sprints 1–4 complete"
status on 2026-05-16. Subsequent commits are quality, observability,
and onboarding polish rather than feature work.
